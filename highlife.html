      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        Highlife is a genre that originated in Ghana in the early 20th century, blending African rhythms with Western musical instruments and traditions. It is known for its lively beats and vibrant brass sounds.
      </p>
      <p> It encompasses multiple local fusions of African metre and western jazz melodies. It uses the melodic and main rhythmic structures of traditional African music, but is typically played with Western instruments. Highlife is characterized by jazzy horns and guitars which lead the band and its use of the two-finger plucking guitar style that is typical of African music. Recently it has acquired an uptempo, synth-driven sound.</p>
